<center><h1>RL 1v1 Tower Logic</h1></center>

# Overview
This repository serves to house the underlying logic for the [Rocket League 1v1 Tower Bot](https://github.com/rrenode/1v1-Tower-Discord-Bot) (a cool name would be nice). The tower logic is built here, tested, and then implemented into the Discord Bot. Currently development is for the [GrindHouse Discord Server](https://discord.gg/grindhouse)'s 1v1 tower, though discussions about expanding the bot and logic to an API both for other developers and players alike have been considered.

## Running Tests
Testing has been implemented with unittest and unittest.mock from the Python standard libraries. The tests are stored in the directory [1v1-Tower-Logic/tests](https://github.com/rrenode/1v1-Tower-Logic/tree/develop/tests). Substantional work is needed before these tests begin proving useful, but alas the foundation is laid for their use.
